## Image Filters using OpenCV

This app is used to apply filters and edit images and download the final image.
There are 7 basic filters:
  - Artistic
  - Black and White / Greyscale
  - Brightness Adjustment
  - Sharpen
  - Pencil Sketch (B&W)
  - Pencil Sketch (Coloured)
  - Color Invert
  
All the filter functions were developed using OpenCV, Numpy and Python Imaging Library (PIL) modules.
